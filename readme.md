# Model of DNA functionalized nano-particles

This program simulates a model of DNA functionalized nano-particles.
The program is written in C++, 
and developed on a Linux system. 

## Build from source

### Get the source code

Clone the repository hosted at github with

```sh
git clone https://github.com/urpedersen/dna_colloid.git
```

The source code files are located in the `dna_colloid` directory.

### Build using make (linux)
Build with make

```sh
make
```

The executable will be in the `bin` directory.

Clean with make

```sh
make clean
```

## Execute the program

### My first run
After the program is built, you should be able to run the examples
located in the `./examples` folder.

```sh
cd examples/default
../../bin/dna_colloid
```

You should see the program output a lot of information about the simulation.
